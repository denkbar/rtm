# rtm
Response Time Manager

This project is currently undergoing a heavy transformation which will soon result in the publication of v3.0.0.

## RTM 2.0 docs

The  2.X standalone app version serving the legacy backboneJS client is covered in the following documentation pages:
http://docs.exense.ch/wiki/rtm/view/Versions/2.0.x/

## RTM 3.0 docs

A redesign of the documentation is on-going. A new, generic webapp implementation based on the [viz library](https://github.com/exense/exense-visualization) and angularJS will be packaged by default in this version. While some dedicated pages might be added here, most of the usage will be documented in the viz project page's itself.

## Developer docs (3.0 only)

The primary information relating to the design, implementation and maintenance of the core aggregation services is published in this repo's [wiki pages](https://github.com/exense/rtm/wiki/Developer-Docs).
